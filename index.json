In familial forms of PD, mutations or copy number variations in SNCA (the α-Syn gene) result in a net increase of its protein levels. Furthermore, common risk variants tied to PD are associated with small increases of wild-type α-Syn levels. These findings are further bolstered by animal studies which show that overexpression of α-Syn is sufficient to cause PD-like features. Thus, increased α-Syn levels are intrinsically tied to PD pathogenesis and underscore the importance of identifying the factors that regulate its levels. In this study, we establish a pooled RNAi screening approach and validation pipeline to probe the druggable genome for modifiers of α-Syn levels and identify 60 promising targets. Using a cross-species, tiered validation approach, we validate six strong candidates that modulate α-Syn levels and toxicity in cell lines, Drosophila, human neurons and mouse brain of both sexes. More broadly, this genetic strategy and validation pipeline can be applied for the identification of therapeutic targets for disorders driven by dosage sensitive proteins. We present a research strategy for the systematic identification and validation of genes modulating the levels of α-synuclein — a protein involved in Parkinson's disease. A cell-based screen of the druggable genome (7,500 genes that are potential therapeutic targets) yielded many modulators of α-synuclein that were subsequently confirmed and validated in Drosophila, human neurons and mouse brain. This approach has broad applicability to the multitude of neurological diseases that are caused by mutations in genes whose dosage is critical for brain function.","tags":null,"title":"A druggable genome screen identifies modifiers of α-synuclein levels via a tiered cross-species validation approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyun-Hwan Jeong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1537549200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537549200,"objectID":"ab33a54e3c9be1418ae515460acf7a20","permalink":"/talk/mbr_2018/","publishdate":"2018-09-21T12:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/mbr_2018/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Targeted genome editing, CRISPR","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Caiwei Guo","Hyun-Hwan Jeong","Yi-Chen Hsieh","Hans-Ulrich Klein","David A Bennett","Philip L De Jager","Zhandong Liu","Joshua M Shulman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528156800,"objectID":"232a0b2b1ff9d7baeee68bd770d2ef04","permalink":"/publication/guo_et_al_2018/","publishdate":"2018-06-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guo_et_al_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Aging and neurodegenerative disease are characterized by genomic instability in neurons, including aberrant activation and mobilization of transposable elements (TEs). Integrating studies of human postmortem brain tissue and Drosophila melanogaster models, we investigate TE activation in association with Tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Leveraging RNA sequencing from 636 human brains, we discover differential expression for several retrotransposons in association with neurofibrillary tangle burden and highlight evidence for global TE transcriptional activation among the long interspersed nuclear element 1 and endogenous retrovirus clades. In addition, we detect Tau-associated, active chromatin signatures at multiple HERV-Fc1 genomic loci. To determine whether Tau is sufficient to induce TE activation, we profile retrotransposons in Drosophila expressing human wild-type or mutant Tau throughout the brain. We discover heterogeneous response profiles, including both age- and genotype-dependent activation of TE expression by Tau. Our results implicate TE activation and associated genomic instability in Tau-mediated AD mechanisms.","tags":null,"title":"Tau activates transposable elements in Alzheimer’s disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyun-Hwan Jeong","Seon Young Kim","Maxime WC Rousseaux","Huda Y Zoghbi","Zhandong Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524787200,"objectID":"66380517aa836de773e21ab4b9ecedc2","permalink":"/publication/jeong_et_al_2018_1/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jeong_et_al_2018_1/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"CRISPRCloud2: A cloud-based platform for deconvoluting CRISPR screen data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyun-Hwan Jeong","Hari Krishna Yalamanchili","Caiwei Guo","Joshua M.
